# Python Learning Journey for AI & Robotics

Self-paced progression from Python fundamentals to AI applications.  
**Background**: Former retail manager transitioning to Artificial Intelligence Engineering.  
**Goal**: Master in Artificial Intelligence at USI Lugano.

### Repository Structure
- `basics/` → Core Python concepts and exercises
- `data-structures/` → Data structures and algorithms
- `notes/` → Key concepts and summaries
- `projects/` → Mini-projects and applications

### Roadmap 2026
- **Jan-Mar** : Python basics (variables, control flow, functions, OOP)
- **Apr-Jun** : Data structures, algorithms, core libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Jul-Sep** : Introduction to Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
- **Oct-Dec** : Deep Learning fundamentals (PyTorch) + first AI projects

### Progress Tracker
| Period       | Topic                                      | Status   |

| Jan 2026     | Variables, input/output, basic operations  | ✅       |
| Jan 2026     | Conditional statements (if/else)           | ✅       |
| Jan 2026     | Loops (for/while) & repetition             | ✅       |
! Jan 2026     | Loops (for/while) & iteration              | ✅       |
! Coming soon  ! Function & modular code                    ! ⏳       !

### Current Exercises
- `basics/hello_world.py` → Basic output and input
- `basics/variables_and_types.py` → Variables and data types
- `basics/conditions.py` → Conditional logic with user input

All commits are incremental and reflect daily learning progress.
